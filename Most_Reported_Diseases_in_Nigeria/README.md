## ⚙️ Process Breakdown

1. **Data Collection**  
   Sourced historical disease datasets from publicly available health records.

2. **Data Cleaning (SQL)**  
   - Removed null and duplicate values  
   - Standardized disease names  
   - Corrected and normalized year formats

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified disease frequency and distribution  
   - Analyzed trends across years and states

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - Bar charts: Top diseases per year  
   - Line charts: Trends over time  
   - Heat maps: State-by-state impact

5. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   - Connected disease spikes with social, economic, and political events (e.g., COVID-19, sanitation campaigns)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Malaria** topped the list every year, accounting for over **40% of total cases**.
- **Typhoid & Tuberculosis** spiked frequently in dense urban areas with poor sanitation.
- Post-2020 saw a rise in **respiratory infections**, linked to **COVID-19** and poor air quality.
- **Waterborne diseases** were most prevalent in Northern Nigeria, while the South saw more lifestyle-related conditions.

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

- Increase **funding for malaria prevention** in high-risk regions.
- Improve **sanitation infrastructure** in densely populated cities.
- Deploy smarter **disease surveillance** tools for early detection and response.
