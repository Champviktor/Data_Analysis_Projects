# 🩺 Most Reported Diseases in Nigeria (2000–2024)

## 📊 Project Summary

Nigeria faces persistent challenges with disease outbreaks and underreported public health trends. This project identifies the **most frequently reported diseases in Nigeria from 2000 to 2024**, empowering policymakers and stakeholders with **data-driven insights** for better decision-making and resource allocation.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
- **Excel** – Data formatting and initial cleaning
- **Google Sheets** – Quick collaboration & checks


## ⚙️ Process Breakdown

1. **Data Collection**  
   Sourced historical disease datasets from publicly available health records.

2. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**  
   - Removed null and duplicate values  
   - Standardized disease names  
   - Corrected and normalized year formats

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified disease frequency and distribution  
   - Analyzed trends across years and states

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - Bar charts: Top diseases per year  
   - Line charts: Trends over time  
   - Heat maps: State-by-state impact

5. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   - Connected disease spikes with social, economic, and political events (e.g., COVID-19, sanitation campaigns)


#### 🔍 **Key Insights**

Nigeria’s health data reflects a dynamic interplay between disease prevalence, environmental crises, and public health interventions:

* **Malaria** remained the **leading disease**, making up **40%+** of all reported cases annually.
* **Typhoid and Tuberculosis** showed recurrent spikes, especially in **overcrowded urban areas** with poor sanitation infrastructure.
* **Post-2020**, there was a notable uptick in **respiratory infections**, tied to **COVID-19**, air pollution, and poor indoor ventilation.
* **Waterborne illnesses** (like cholera) were most concentrated in **Northern Nigeria**, while the **South** reported more **lifestyle-related conditions** such as diabetes and hypertension.

#### 📈 **Significant Spikes**

* 🔺 **2008** – **Cholera & Lassa Fever** surged due to **floods and poor containment**.
* 🔺 **2015** – Rise in **Lassa Fever** cases, aided by **improved disease surveillance and reporting systems**.
* 🔺 **2022** – **Worst flooding in over a decade** led to a massive **cholera outbreak** across multiple states.

#### 📉 **Notable Drops**

* 🔻 **2017** – Likely **underreporting** due to **health facility breakdowns** and infrastructural gaps.
* 🔻 **2023** – Marked **reduction** in cases, thanks to **post-flood health interventions** and targeted responses.


## 🎯 **Recommendations**

To curb disease surges and build resilience, we recommend:

* 💰 **Boost Malaria Funding**: Prioritize malaria prevention in high-burden regions through treated nets, indoor spraying, and seasonal interventions.
* 🏙️ **Upgrade Sanitation in Urban Centers**: Invest in waste management and sewage systems to tackle typhoid and TB outbreaks.
* 📡 **Adopt Smart Surveillance Tools**: Leverage digital health platforms and AI to detect outbreaks early and enable real-time response.
* 🚰 **Expand Clean Water Infrastructure**: Especially in Northern Nigeria, to reduce cholera and other waterborne illnesses.
* 🏥 **Enhance Hospital Reporting Systems**: Digitize and streamline reporting for quicker, data-driven health interventions.
* 📢 **Launch Seasonal Health Campaigns**: Educate the public during flood seasons to reduce panic and promote early care-seeking behavior.


## ✅ **Conclusion**

Disease data isn’t just about numbers. It’s a mirror reflecting how **health, environment, and policy** collide.
Each spike tells a story: of **floods**, **system gaps**, and sometimes, of **interventions that worked**.
This dashboard turns complex health data into actionable insight guiding smarter policies, faster responses, and ultimately, **healthier futures** for Nigeria.
